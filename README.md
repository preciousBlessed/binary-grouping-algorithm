# My-Binary-Grouping-Algorithm

- This program will randomly group n persons into two groups labelled "group 1" and "group 2".

# Application of Algorithm

- This basic algorithm finds application in every system that might randomly want to group a given sample data into two parts for some specific temporary or parmanent task.
- While currently in my NYCS Program, I set up this algorithm basically to group the men in the male-hostel randomly into two
  groups basically for discharge of duties one group after another.

# How to Run the App

- For now, the application still works via interaction with computer terminal. The default configuration to run the application is

```
node group.js
```
